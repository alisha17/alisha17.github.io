Professionally:

I am a generalist software engineer who likes to learn new things. After years of working with amazing organisations and amazing
people, I am now focusing on running my software consultancy.

- My tech interests include: bioinformatics, astronomy and fintech (I know there's no correlation between them) 
- My tech stack includes: Python, Javascript (ReactJS, NodeJS), NLP & ML, Spark, AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes
- Special interests in: Rust and Haskell

Some organisations I have worked with in the past and present: 
- European Bioinformatics Institute
- Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)
- Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)
- Macquarie Bank
- Linux
- Fedora
- Insurance Australia Group (IAG)
- Sportradar
- Diversity Arrays
- University of Melbourne

Personally:

- I like being outdoors - hiking, trekking, running or just strolling in the parks
- I like traveling - history, culture, arts and food
- I like watching tv series and movies - I quote `The Office` too much!
- And I definitely love sleeping (genuinely sleeping, nothing dirty!)

Always open to fruitful collaborations and contractual/freelance projects.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or you could just drop me a message (via Twitter, LinkedIn or my email) and say hi!
