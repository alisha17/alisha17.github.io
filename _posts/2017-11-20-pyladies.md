This post is about the talk I gave in [PyLadies Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/PyLadies-Melbourne/events/241058465/) meetup on Monday, 20th November'17.  
I discussed what is Machine Learning, the common methods and evaluation metrics. If you are a complete beginner to machine learning, this talk is for you. Here is the [PDF]({{ site.url }}/assets/introml.pdf) of the talk.  
  
Also, following are the pdfs of my 'Knowledge Technologies' subject lectures, projects and sample exam papers, which introduces the concepts of information retrieval, machine learning and data mining.  
This is good for someone who wants to study a structured university course. It was really helpful for me. I hope it will help you as well! :)

Machine Learning part starts from lecture set 6, but it will reap out most benefits if you start from lecture set 1.
