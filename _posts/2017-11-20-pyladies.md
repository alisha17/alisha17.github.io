This post is about the talk I gave in [PyLadies Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/PyLadies-Melbourne/events/241058465/) meetup on Monday, 20th November'17.
I initially planned to discuss about my deep learning project 'Count the number of cars in
overhead imagery' (discussed here: [link](https://alisha17.github.io/silverpond/2017/10/18/mlai.html)) which I am doing in my Machine Learning internship,
but then I thought maybe not everyone at the meetup would be familiar with Machine Learning and
Deep Learning. So, I modified my talk aiming at the beginners.

I discussed what is Machine Learning, the common methods and evaluation metrics. If you are a
complete beginner to machine learning, this talk is for you. Here is the [PDF]({{ site.url }}/assets/introml.pdf) of the talk.
