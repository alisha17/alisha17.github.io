Recently I came across a problem in which I had to convert .evtx files (Windows Event Log files) to a human readable format like XML, CSV, JSON etc.

Thereâ€™s this popular and only working parser that I know about [python-evtx](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-evtx). It parses .evtx files to XML format.

These are the steps which I followed:

* Clone the python-evtx directory in your system.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/williballenthin/python-evtx.git
  ```

* Go into the cloned directory.

  ```
  cd python-evtx
  ```

* Install the libraries

  ```
  python3 setup.py install
  ```

* Go to the scripts directory inside python-evtx.

  ```
  cd scripts
  ```

* Run the following command if you just have one file which you want to convert.

  ```
  python3 evtx_dump.py /mnt/data/alisha/logs/dc/security.evtx
  ```

* In my case, I had folders inside folders which had .evtx files to convert, so I did:

  ```
  for file in $(find /mnt/data/alisha/logs/ -iname "*.evtx")
  do
  	python3 evtx_dump.py $file > /mnt/data/alisha/parsed-evtx/`basename "$file"`.xml
  	echo "$file: $?" >> conversion.log
  done
  ```

  It will first check every file inside the logs folder for .evtx extension and run evtx_dump.py on every
  file thereafter storing the <filename>.xml in a new folder, i.e., parsed-evtx. If it is not able to parse
  a file into XML due to some error, the filename will get saved in conversion.log.

  I hope this will help someone!
