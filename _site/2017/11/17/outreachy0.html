<p>My tryst with Outreachy</p>

<p>I first heard of Outreachy through a friend in 2015. But, at that time, I just completed
my undergraduation and was not confident of myself AT ALL, which is really justifiable,
since you cannot think of working for top-notch organizations/communities like Mozilla,
Fedora, Linux, Wikimedia and many more..</p>

<p>However, I was really intrigued with the idea of Free and Open Source Software. Hence, I
decided to make some contributions towards it.
Mozilla is an organisation that everyone must have heard since childhood because atleast I
am using Firefox from the time I first started using computers. Fortunately, I had a friend
who was already a contributor to Mozilla automation and tooling projects. She introduced me to
a senior Engineer working at Mozilla. He mentored</p>

<p>Then, I decided to apply for Outreachy round 15 (June-August&#39;17). There were some many awesome
organisations and projects. I was already familiar with Mozilla Bug Tracking system and how the
reviews etc. work. I chose 2-3 projects which I found interesting. I contributed to</p>

<p>The project that I was most interested in was &#39;Rust Web Assembly Showcase&#39;, Rust is a new language
which I never worked on before and afterall fun is always in learning something new. Isn&#39;t?</p>

<p>The project</p>
