   <title>Interview Experience with HDE Inc.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hde/2017/09/02/hde-interview/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HDE Inc. is a Japanese Cloud Security Provider established in 1996 and their Global Internship Program (GIP) has become very popular in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some benefits of this internship:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 150,000 JPY/month subsidy. The subsidy is given to cover living costs such as meals, commuting expense, and accommodation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round-trip airfares coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more info, refer this link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hde.co.jp/en/gip/&quot;&gt;HDE GIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The process was as follows: (as of June 2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer Letter (if successful!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s have a look at all these components one by one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROGRAMMING TEST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming test involved writing a program in Golang, which was not exactly easy. It required some thinking because I found Golang a very limited language as compared to Python (I have mostly programmed in Python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To send this program to HDE, it involved writing another program for which I had to go through technical RFC documentations (to do authentication and generate password etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end,  I had to make use of requests and HTTP to actually hit the HDE&amp;#39;s API to send them the program. The program had to be written in a private gist (so knowledge of Github is essential).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT CHEAT. Because even if you are successful at this stage, at the next stage you will be eliminated if you cheat because in the interview they actually ask questions about the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I succeeded in the programming test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was informed about the schedule of the online interview within 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ONLINE INTERVIEW&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online interview was conducted on Skype. It was more like a behavioral one. There were three interviewers and all were very friendly. We even talked about sushis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked questions about some open source projects of mine, challenges that I faced while programming and general questions about my willingness to travel to Japan and University subjects etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be yourself, don&amp;#39;t be nervous, answer questions honestly. If you don&amp;#39;t know something, say &amp;#39;no&amp;#39; straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.- It will be good if you know Python or Golang because their projects are mostly in these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OFFER LETTER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the offer letter within two weeks. I had to choose an internship slot. The department is Cloud Product Development Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each internship slot is approximately of 6 weeks, and this program runs all year round. A candidate is free to select any time frame which suits him/her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HR was cooperative as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a smooth experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will update my internship experience once I start. There&amp;#39;s still time in it. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT : HDE team visited Melbourne and we had a nice dinner at +39 Pizzeria on 14th Sept&amp;#39;17. It was an informal meeting and the peeps from HDE were so friendly. I didn&amp;#39;t feel even for a second that I was meeting them for the first time. We clicked some pics as well, though not really high quality ones but yeah, manageable!&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Week of Machine Learning Internship at SilverPond</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/silverpond/2017/08/27/first-week/"/>
   <updated>2017-08-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/silverpond/2017/08/27/first-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I joined SilverPond as a Machine Learning Intern under the Victorian Chamber Internship Program. It was an interesting opportunity and I was very excited for it since working with data has always intrigued me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SilverPond is a team of data scientists, machine learning specialists, software engineers and mathematicians who design solutions to hard problems. For over 13 years, they have developed big data and software solutions for clients in various industries ranging from utilities, retail, and technology, to healthcare, education and research like Australia Post and 7-11. They are also actively involved in sharing knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and various other technologies by hosting meetups and conferences. Compose:: Melbourne (Functional Programming Conference) is supported and managed by SilverPond its team members. They are also holding a 2-day Deep Learning Workshop on 6th and 7th Sept&amp;#39;17. The curriculum looks pretty interesting for anyone who would like to supplement their Data Science learning. The details can be found here: Deep Learning Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first day involved creating accounts across various mediums that Silverpond uses for collaboration like Asana (just like Trello), Slack, Gitlab and conventional email account and setting up the in-house project, Silverbrane. While setting up, some issues cropped up but eventually I resolved it and added these in the documentation. But it&amp;#39;s technology stack involves Ruby on Rails, in which I am not really proficient, so my first step involved getting familiar with the main functioning of the project and Ruby (of course!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I found some bugs in Silverbrane and picked up one to resolve which I did but now I am struggling with fixing test for it in RSpec (which I hope to resolve soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every team member at SilverPond was very welcoming and made sure that I felt at ease on the very first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week would be interesting because I hope to dive into a bit of Machine Learning part of the Silverbrane. Also, I would be volunteering for the Compose:: Melbourne (28th-29th Aug&amp;#39;17), which would be surely an enriching experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would share my second week internship experience and the highlights of Compose:: Melbourne soon! :)&lt;/p&gt;
