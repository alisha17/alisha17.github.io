&lt;p&gt;Code Camp is a fun coding camp of 2, 3 and 4 days where children learn to code. They get a hands-on experience of what coding is. The classes are divided into 4 groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Little League&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group is for kids aged between 5 - 6 or who are in grades K - 1 and who have no idea of what coding is.  Each Little League camp comes equipped with iPads for the whole class to enjoy. The kids build awesome mini-games and learn about coding in the process. This group is a combination of online and offline activities. For more info, check here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codecamp.com.au/camp-league/&quot;&gt;Little-league&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group is for kids aged between 7 - 12 or who are in grades 2 - 6 with beginner&amp;#39;s knowledge and are ready to hop on to intermediate stage. This is the most popular group. They make their own mobile phone game playable via the Code Camp App (which can be downloaded on Apple and Android phones). The kids get a taste of real world coding by doing &amp;#39;Drag and Drop&amp;#39; coding using the proprietory software &amp;#39;Code Camp World&amp;#39;. This is even accessible after the camp ends, so they can practice and have fun at home too, taking help from the video tutorials! For more info, check here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codecamp.com.au/camp-spark/&quot;&gt;spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ignite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group is for kids aged between 7 - 12 or who are in grades 2 - 6 with intermediate knowledge and are ready to hop on to advanced stage. They make their own mobile phone game playable via the Code Camp App (which can be downloaded on Apple and Android phones). The kids get a taste of real world coding by doing advanced &amp;#39;Drag and Drop&amp;#39; coding and line coding using Javascript on the last day of the camp using the proprietory software &amp;#39;Code Camp World&amp;#39;. This is even accessible after the camp ends, so they can practice and have fun at home too, taking help from the video tutorials! For more info, check here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codecamp.com.au/camp-ignite/&quot;&gt;ignite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group is for kids aged between 8 - 13 or who are in grades 3 - 7 and have completed the Spark and Ignite. This is for advanced students only as they learn coding in pure Javascript. They make their own mobile phone game playable via the Code Camp App (which can be downloaded on Apple and Android phones), using line coding in pure Javascript. For more info, check here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codecamp.com.au/camp-blast/&quot;&gt;blast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each class has a staff of atleast three people, including head teacher and teaching assistants. Each camp has atleast two camp managers and a first aid practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a teaching assistant for the Ignite group in the camp conducted at University of Melbourne during the spring holidays 2017. There was a Code Camp meet and greet two weeks before the camp to prepare the staff for their respective roles. There was a party as well, so that the staff can know each other well. I didn&amp;#39;t go, so I can&amp;#39;t elaborate on how it was :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a three day camp, and I had a lot of fun. I love kids, I love teaching and I love coding (obviously, being a software programmer myself!). It is a very fulfilling role, where you know you are building the foundation for technologists of the future. I saw the amazed look on people&amp;#39;s face due to the response they got for the question &amp;#39;what the camp is for&amp;#39;, keeping in mind that all kids were of age group 5 - 13, with average age being 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timings for the camp were 9 am - 3.30 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, all the kids were provided with a Code Camp t-shirt and a hat. As far as learning is concerned, they learnt Drag and Drop coding in the Code Camp World software, where they could keep practicing at home as well. There were two breaks in between, a recess and a lunch break so that the kids can have some outdoor time and get refreshed. The day ended with a cheerful note, with all the kids being happy about the exciting things they learnt during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, the kids were taught about some advanced concepts in Drag and Drop coding like logic, UI, Math functions etc. They made many mini games inside the main game using these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third and the last day, they finished their mini games using Drag and Drop and made another mini game using line coding only, i.e. using Javascript. An unexpected observation was that the kids found line coding more fun and easier than the Drag and Drop coding (i.e. Block Coding)! During the lunch break, there was a silent disco party where all the teachers and kids were provided with headphones playing some great classic party tracks ;) All the games were published by 3 pm on the Code Camp portal and the students showcased their games and even challenged their friends to complete various levels in their games. The games can be accessed from the Code Camp app. Each kid gets a code and using that code, one can find his/her game in the app. Here is an example screenshot for the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/codecamp/5.png&quot; alt=&quot;pizzeria hde5&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, everyone had mixed feelings, as it was an exciting experience but saying goodbyes is always the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshots of the games made by the kids during the camp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/codecamp/6.png&quot; alt=&quot;pizzeria hde5&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/codecamp/8.png&quot; alt=&quot;pizzeria hde7&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/codecamp/9.png&quot; alt=&quot;pizzeria hde8&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading the post. Thanks! Tada! :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interview Experience with HDE Inc.</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/hde/2017/09/02/hde-interview/"/>
   <updated>2017-09-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/hde/2017/09/02/hde-interview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;HDE Inc. is a Japanese Cloud Security Provider established in 1996 and their Global Internship Program (GIP) has become very popular in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some benefits of this internship:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 150,000 JPY/month subsidy. The subsidy is given to cover living costs such as meals, commuting expense, and accommodation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Round-trip airfares coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more info, refer this link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hde.co.jp/en/gip/&quot;&gt;HDE GIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The process was as follows: (as of June 2017)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online Interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer Letter (if successful!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s have a look at all these components one by one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PROGRAMMING TEST&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming test involved writing a program in Golang, which was not exactly easy. It required some thinking because I found Golang a very limited language as compared to Python (I have mostly programmed in Python).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To send this program to HDE, it involved writing another program for which I had to go through technical RFC documentations (to do authentication and generate password etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end,  I had to make use of requests and HTTP to actually hit the HDE&amp;#39;s API to send them the program. The program had to be written in a private gist (so knowledge of Github is essential).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT CHEAT. Because even if you are successful at this stage, at the next stage you will be eliminated if you cheat because in the interview they actually ask questions about the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I succeeded in the programming test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was informed about the schedule of the online interview within 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ONLINE INTERVIEW&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online interview was conducted on Skype. It was more like a behavioral one. There were three interviewers and all were very friendly. We even talked about sushis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked questions about some open source projects of mine, challenges that I faced while programming and general questions about my willingness to travel to Japan and University subjects etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be yourself, don&amp;#39;t be nervous, answer questions honestly. If you don&amp;#39;t know something, say &amp;#39;no&amp;#39; straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.- It will be good if you know Python or Golang because their projects are mostly in these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OFFER LETTER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received the offer letter within two weeks. I had to choose an internship slot. The department is Cloud Product Development Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each internship slot is approximately of 6 weeks, and this program runs all year round. A candidate is free to select any time frame which suits him/her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HR was cooperative as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a smooth experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will update my internship experience once I start. There&amp;#39;s still time in it. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT : HDE team visited Melbourne and we had a nice dinner at +39 Pizzeria on 14th Sept&amp;#39;17. It was an informal meeting and the peeps from HDE were so friendly. I didn&amp;#39;t feel even for a second that I was meeting them for the first time. We clicked some pics as well, though not really high quality ones but yeah, manageable!&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Week of Machine Learning Internship at SilverPond</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/silverpond/2017/08/27/first-week/"/>
   <updated>2017-08-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/silverpond/2017/08/27/first-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I joined SilverPond as a Machine Learning Intern under the Victorian Chamber Internship Program. It was an interesting opportunity and I was very excited for it since working with data has always intrigued me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SilverPond is a team of data scientists, machine learning specialists, software engineers and mathematicians who design solutions to hard problems. For over 13 years, they have developed big data and software solutions for clients in various industries ranging from utilities, retail, and technology, to healthcare, education and research like Australia Post and 7-11. They are also actively involved in sharing knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and various other technologies by hosting meetups and conferences. Compose:: Melbourne (Functional Programming Conference) is supported and managed by SilverPond its team members. They are also holding a 2-day Deep Learning Workshop on 5th and 6th Dec&amp;#39;17. The curriculum looks pretty interesting for anyone who would like to supplement their Data Science learning. The details can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/deep-learning-2-day-workshop-december-tickets-36675083161?aff=erellivmlt&quot;&gt;Deep Learning Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first day involved creating accounts across various mediums that Silverpond uses for collaboration like Asana (just like Trello), Slack, Gitlab and conventional email account and setting up the in-house project, Silverbrane. While setting up, some issues cropped up but eventually I resolved it and added these in the documentation. But it&amp;#39;s technology stack involves Ruby on Rails, in which I am not really proficient, so my first step involved getting familiar with the main functioning of the project and Ruby (of course!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I found some bugs in Silverbrane and picked up one to resolve which I did but now I am struggling with fixing test for it in RSpec (which I hope to resolve soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every team member at SilverPond was very welcoming and made sure that I felt at ease on the very first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week would be interesting because I hope to dive into a bit of Machine Learning part of the Silverbrane. Also, I would be volunteering for the Compose:: Melbourne (28th-29th Aug&amp;#39;17), which would be surely an enriching experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would share my second week internship experience and the highlights of Compose:: Melbourne soon! :)&lt;/p&gt;
