I love programming, watching movies, teaching and running. I love eating and trying out new cuisines and restaurants too.

I completed my Master of Science (Computer Science) from University of Melbourne. My thesis is on 'Fake News Detection on Twitter by Evaluating User Credibility'.

Previously, I have interned with Silverpond as a Machine Learning Engineer, Fedora as a Software Engineer and Linux as a Software Engineer.

I have worked at Move37 as a Software Engineer where I worked on the Natural Language Processing features of the product.

I am currently working at CSIRO's Data61, which is an Australian Commonwealth Research Organization. I am working in the Privacy Enhancing Systems group.

I have experience in Python, Javascript, NodeJS, ReactJS, Scala and a bit of Haskell.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or you could just maybe drop me a message (via Twitter, LinkedIn or my email) and say hi!
