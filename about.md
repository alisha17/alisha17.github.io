I am a Master of Science (Computer Science) student at University of Melbourne. I will graduate at the end of 2018. I am working on my research thesis for "Detection of fake news on social media platforms using credibility evaluation."

I love programming and I think Python is my favorite language.

I have a keen interest in Machine Learning. I have interned with SilverPond as a Machine Learning Engineer and currently working at Move37 as a Software Engineer (wherein my work involved Natural Language Processing).
I have previously interned with Fedora and Linux Foundation.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or you could just maybe drop me a message (via Twitter, LinkedIn or my email) and say hi!
