Hmmm..So I am Alisha. And I am awesome. (I know this sounds like a self-loving person and I absolutely love myself, because if you can't love yourself, why will others love you? Too philosophical..:P)

I am a Master of Science (Computer Science) student at University of Melbourne. I am always interested in learning new technologies and up for challenges.

I love programming in Python and learning Rust since the summer of 2017. I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning. At the moment, I am interning as a Machine Learning Engineer at SilverPond, Melbourne.
I will soon write a series of posts on Deep Learning, starting from beginner level :)

I am an open source enthusiast, my most contributions done towards Mozilla and Rustlang. Though, these days
I am also working on Fedora's 389-Directory Server.

This is me :)
