  Hey there! Some background about me....
</p>

I am a Master of Science (Computer Science) student at University of Melbourne. I am always interested in learning new technologies and up for challenges.

I love programming in Python and learning Rust and Ruby on Rails from past few months. I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning. At the moment, I am interning as a Machine Learning Engineer at SilverPond, Melbourne.

I am an open source enthusiast, my most contributions done towards Mozilla and Rustlang, though, I am also starting out with Fedora now.
